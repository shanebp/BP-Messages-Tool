A BuddyPress tool for viewing messages

== Description ==

BP Messages Tool is a BuddyPress plugin.

By default, nobody can read a BuddyPress private message unless it was sent or received by the current logged-in member.

Occasionally, there is a need to respond to member complaints about another member harassing them via abusive messages.

This tool allows site administrators to review the messages of any member. They can also delete Message Threads.

It provides a wp-admin screen available via Tools > BP Messages.

You can allow members to block each other by using [BuddyBlock](https://www.philopress.com/products/buddyblock/ "BuddyBlock")
